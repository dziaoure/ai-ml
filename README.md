# AI/Machine Learning Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a curated portfolio of end-to-end AI/ML projects demonstrating practical, production-oriented machine learning skills across multiple domains.

Each project focuses on:
- real-world problem framing
- sound modeling choices
- proper evaluation metrics
- interpretability and error analysis
- deployable demos (where applicable)

The goal of this portfolio is not academic breadth, but applied ML competence suitable for contract and consulting work.

## Projects
### Regression — Predictive Modeling
**Focus**: Structured data regression
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Regularization (Ridge / Lasso)
- Model evaluation & diagnostics
- Clear business interpretation of results


### Recommendation Systems
**Focus**: User–item interaction modeling
- Collaborative filtering
- Baseline vs personalized models
- Evaluation of recommendation quality
- Practical recommendation logic

### Time Series Forecasting
**Focus**: Temporal demand forecasting
- Train/validation splits respecting time
- Feature engineering for seasonality & trends
- Forecast evaluation and visualization
- Deployment via interactive demo

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) — Text Classification
**Focus**: Unstructured text modeling
- TF-IDF + Linear SVM pipeline
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Macro-F1 evaluation
- Model explainability (token contributions)
- Streamlit demo for live inference

### Reinforcement Learning — Dynamic Pricing
**Focus**: Sequential decision-making under uncertainty
- Multi-armed bandit formulation
- Epsilon-Greedy vs UCB1 comparison
- Reward vs regret analysis
- Multi-run statistical evaluation
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard


## Technical Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

Projects emphasize **clarity, robustness, and interpretability** over unnecessary complexity.


## Design Philosophy

This portfolio intentionally prioritizes:
- classical, well-understood algorithms
- strong baselines before complexity
- evaluation metrics aligned with business objectives
- reproducibility and clean structure

Modern ML systems often fail due to poor framing, evaluation, or interpretability — this work focuses on avoiding those pitfalls.

## Intended Audience

This repository is designed for:
- companies seeking contract ML engineers
- startups evaluating applied ML capability
- technical interviews and live demos

Each project can be explained clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## How to Navigate

Each project folder contains:
- a dedicated README
- notebooks for exploration & analysis
- clean training code
- demo applications where relevant
