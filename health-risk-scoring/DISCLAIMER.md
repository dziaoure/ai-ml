# Disclaimer

This project is for demonstration and educational purposes only.  
It is **not** intended for clinical use, medical diagnosis, treatment decisions, or any form of professional healthcare guidance.

The dataset, models, and visualizations included in this repository are simplified representations of a complex real-world problem and may not reflect actual clinical risk.  
No part of this project should be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

## Fairness and Bias Disclaimer

This project may inherit or amplify biases present in the Framingham Heart Study dataset.  
Because the dataset is limited in demographic diversity and historical context, the model may not generalize fairly across gender, ethnicity, geography, or socioeconomic status.

No bias mitigation, reweighting, or fairness constraints have been applied.  
As such, the predictions and risk scores generated by this model should **not** be used in any real-world context involving patient care, insurance evaluation, access to programs, or decisions with ethical implications.

Any organization intending to adapt or extend this work must conduct its own fairness assessments, bias mitigation procedures, and regulatory compliance reviews before deployment.

Use this project at your own discretion.
